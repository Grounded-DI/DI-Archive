## 🔍 What Is This?

This scroll explores the strange but beautiful fact that **prime numbers form diagonal streaks** when plotted in an Ulam spiral — and shows why this happens using **quadratic equations**.

## 🧮 What’s an Ulam Spiral?

Imagine writing numbers in a square spiral — starting with 1 in the center and moving outward.  
Now mark every prime number with a white dot.  
Something strange happens:

> Diagonal lines appear. Not randomly. **Consistently.**

---

## 🧠 Why Do the Diagonals Appear?

Some math formulas, like `4n² + 1`, produce numbers that:
- Fall only on **one diagonal** in the spiral
- Often turn out to be **prime**

So that diagonal “lights up.”

It’s not that primes form lines randomly.  
It’s that **certain formulas** drop their outputs in **precise diagonal paths**, and when those values are prime, **the spiral reveals the pattern**.

## 📊 Testing the Top 3 Quadratic Forms

We tested how often these 3 forms produce prime numbers, from n = 1 to 100:

| Form         | Prime Count | Total Terms | Prime Density |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `4n² + 1`     | 33          | 100         | 33%            |
| `n² + n + 41` | 86          | 100         | 86%            |
| `6n² + 1`     | 27          | 100         | 27%            |

🎯 The form `n² + n + 41` is a **classic prime-generator** — it was designed that way.  
But even the natural forms like `4n² + 1` produce **rich prime diagonals**.

## 🌀 Visual: Ulam Spiral (201×201)

The white dots are primes. Notice how they **cluster along diagonals** — that’s not random.  
That’s structure.

## 🧩 Deeper Insight

Let’s take `4n² + 1`.

It avoids divisibility by 2, 3, and often 5. That means it skips over many non-primes.

More importantly:  
All of its outputs land **on one specific diagonal** in the spiral layout.  
So if those outputs are prime, that whole diagonal begins to glow.

This is a **modular resonance pattern** — not randomness.

## 📣 Call to Mathematicians

We’d love help testing:
- Other quadratic forms
- Diagonal density decay as n grows
- Symmetry in mod classes across spiral axes
